# Monthly_Balance_Sheet

## Purpose
The purpose of the Monthly_Balance_Sheet is to recreate the Monthly Balance Sheet in Yardi.  This view omits Current Earnings 3850.0000 from the report (these values are reported in Monthly_Balance_Sheet_CE by request). Amounts are gathered from `fort-operating-system.Data_Warehouse.General_Ledger_Entries`.  General_Ledger_Entries is built using `fort-operating-system.Data_Warehouse_Staging.GLDETAIL`.  Issues in Monthly_Balance_Sheet will need to be checked in these two tables as well.

## yardi_GLDETAIL
*from Yardi Data Dictionary*

This Expands The Detail Table To Show Both The Debit And Credit Sides Of Each Transaction By Book.

*Additional notes from Dokumen*

- The GLDETAIL table was introduced in Voyager 6.0 to allow for faster report processing of G/L activity.
- When transactions are posted, a GLDETAIL record is created for each Debit/Credit made to the general ledger.
- The GLDETAIL table is indexed to provide optimal searching efficiency, only holding pertinent information.
- While TRANS and DETAIL tables hold raw data, the GLDETAIL table is the expanded result of the TRANS/DETAIL tables, showing the posted transactions impact on the general ledger.
- One TRANS record or one DETAIL record will create multiple GLDETAIL records depending on transaction type
- Key columns for filtering are hProp, hAcct, iBook, and dtPost
- Key columns for selection are dAmount, sTranNum, hPerson, sRef, sNotes, dtDate
- iBook: 0 is Cash, 1 is Accrual
- Other books: only on JE
- No iBook of 1000 in GLDetail table
- Detail table contains the line item details of transactions
- Charges are unusual in that they are stored in only the Trans table. Other transactions (Receipt, Payable, Payment, Journal) have records in the Detail table.
- Primary key is sequential number
- Foreign Key(s) â€“ hInvOrRec / hChkOrChg point to hmy of Trans table
